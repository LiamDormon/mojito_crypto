# ðŸ“‰ Mojito Crypto ðŸ“ˆ

Typescript crypto mining resource for QBCore fivem framework. Earn passive income by buying mining rigs and upgrade them with new graphics cards.

## Features
- Earn qbits passively by owning mining rigs and upgrading them
- Different tiers of rigs can contain a different number of graphics cards
- Hashrate and power draw of the card is used to calculate profits
- Place a mining rig anywhere on the map
- Advanced prop placing mechanic
- Logs to console

## Config
To enable console output use `set mojito_debug 1` into your server.cfg 

Config: 
```js
{
  "BasicRigCardLimit": 2,                       // Amount of GPUS which can be inside of the basic rig
  "AdvancedRigCardLimit": 5,
  "BasicRigItemName": "basic_miningrig",        // Item name for your mining rigs
  "AdvancedRigItemName": "advanced_miningrig",  
  "TickRate": 24                                // Time in minutes it takes for each cycle
}
```
Cards: 

```json
{
  "itemname": {
    "hashrate": 100.0,
    "wattage": 200.0
  }
}
```

```
The card config takes the format of the itemname as the key with hashrate and wattage.
Profit is calculated by taking the hashrate and dividing it by 10% of the power draw. i.e. in this example the profit per tick would be 5 qbits.

These numbers pre-configured were taken from https://whattomine.com/ and have not been balanced, so I strongly recommend comming up with your own figures!

## Installation
Download the latest release or compile from the source.

Add miningrigs table to your database:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `player_miningrigs` (
  `id` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `citizenid` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `rig` text DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`citizenid`),
  KEY `id` (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;

```

Run the script and enjoy
